# Hardened name-service abstractions for AE-DIR services

  # Many programs wish to perform nameservice-like operations, such as
  # looking up users by name or id, groups by name or id, hosts by name
  # or IP, etc. These operations may be performed through files, dns,
  # NIS, NIS+, LDAP, hesiod, wins, etc. Allow them all here.
