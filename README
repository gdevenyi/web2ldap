web2ldap - Web-based LDAPv3 client
------------------------------------------------------------------------

See HTML documentation in htdocs/ or visit https://www.web2ldap.de

What is web2ldap?

* A generic LDAPv3 client which does not make any assumptions about the
  tree structure or LDAP schema.
* Kind of a swiss-army knife for accessing/manipulating LDAP servers
  without having to configure anything.
* A secure LDAP client with clean login behaviour.
* A schema browser which displays references/dependencies within an
  LDAPv3 schema.
* A customizable platform for prototyping LDAP administration use-cases.
* For me it is a platform for implementing cutting edge LDAP_features.
* Continously maintained software since September 1998!

What it's not?

* A light-weight search interface.
* An administration user interface for your secretary to maintain your
  specific corporate address book with a strict workflow.
  (Side note: It seems this comment was heavily misunderstood. I'm
  simply honest and this comment applies to any other generic LDAP
  client I know of. Still other LDAP client tools are even less powerful
  for this task, especially less customizable.)

Project status

This software is still actively developed. Check the announcements_page
and the roadmap.
