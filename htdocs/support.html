<h2>Commercial</h2>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  I try my best to make <a href="install.html">installation</a> easy - at least for people
  used to installing similar software. But this can be sometimes
  hard for non-admins. Therefore I am offering installation support.
  Please do not hesitate to ask for
  <a href="https://www.stroeder.com/impressum.html">me</a>
  for commercial installation support.
</p>

<h3>Customization</h3>
<p>
  Although web2ldap is designed to be very comfortable it is
  today much too powerful for unexperienced users who just want
  to do simple repeating jobs like searching a specific sort of
  entries or adding same entries many times. The reason is that
  web2ldap is a generic LDAP client providing all kind of actions you
  want to do with a LDAP directory without making any assumptions
  about the directory's DIT or schema.<br>
  If you have the requirement for a customized web gateway to your
  own LDAP server which is easy-to-use for end-users feel free to
  contact <a href="https://www.stroeder.com/impressum.html">me</a> for further
  information about commercial variants and support.
