  <dt>Installation and configuration changes</dt>
  <dd>
    The following changes to system installation and local configuration were made:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Requires Python 2.7.9+
      </li>
      <li>
        It is now possible to install with PIP.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do not use the PIP-based installation note that some
        module dependencies have changed:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Module <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ldap0">ldap0</a>
            used instead of <var>python-ldap</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Module <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipaddress">ipaddress</a>
            used instead of <var>netaddr</var> (and formerly <var>ipaddr</var>).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        LDAP OID registry is no longer considered local configuration and
        was thus moved to an internal module.
      </li>
      <li>
        Config module <var>web2ldapcnf</var> was moved to top-level directory.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>New features/enhancements</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Dropped features</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dropped configuration variable <var>pylibdirs</var> which caused
        too much hen-and-egg problems and thus was not useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        No separate error and debug log configuration variables anymore.
        Errors now always go to <var>stderr</var> which was the default anyway.
      </li>
      <li>
        The half-baken <var>SIGHUP</var> config reload handler was removed.
        Actually it was never really useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Abandoned internal gzip compressing because it is much better to
        leave this to the invoking web server.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
