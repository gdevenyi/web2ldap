This lists small issues and open questions too unimportant for the roadmap.

web2ldap 1.4
------------

  - Uploading attribute *jpegPhoto* does not work although uploading other
    binary attributes seems to work.

  - Shall *sp_entity* also be used to escape single spaces?

  - Maintain limited list of DNs last searched by MyLDAPObject.search()
    and use these as <datalist> in DN input field of *ldapparams*.
